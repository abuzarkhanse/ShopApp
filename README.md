# ShopApp (FYPShopApp) – React Native E-Commerce Mobile App

ShopApp (FYPShopApp) is a simple e-commerce mobile application built with **React Native (Community CLI)** and **TypeScript** as part of a university **Mobile Application Development / Final Year Project**.

The app demonstrates a clean shopping flow:

- Login & Registration
- Home with categories, offers, and top-selling products
- Product detail with sizes, colors, quantity, and add-to-cart UI

The codebase is intentionally **beginner-friendly**, with:

- Clear folder structure
- No inline styles (all styles in `StyleSheet.create`)
- Easy to follow screens and navigation
